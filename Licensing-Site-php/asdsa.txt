So i want to Create an Webpage with PHP and HTML it needs to have these Features Register with License Key, Username and Password. Login with Username and Password. On the User dashboard are these Features: See Changelogs, Download Programm, See Status! On the Admin Dashboard are these Features: Add something to the Changelogs, Change the Status and Download Link, Generate License Keys. On the Userdashboard needs to be an Logout and Discord Button to the Logout Button needs to be on the Admin Dashboard aswell and the First Registered User doesnt need an License Key Because he is the Admin!
